# The behavior of RuboCop can be controlled via the .rubocop.yml
# configuration file. It makes it possible to enable/disable
# certain cops (checks) and to alter their behavior if they accept
# any parameters. The file can be placed either in your home
# directory or in some project directory.
#
# RuboCop will start looking for the configuration file in the directory
# where the inspected file is and continue its way up to the root directory.

# Blocks are used to structure tests and are part of the shoulda dsl.
# The standard BlockLength limits are too stringent for this purpose.
# Block DSL is also used in routes
# We should be careful keeping rake tasks here, as large tasks are still an issue.
# Not sure if we need to split namespaces across several files though.
# We exclude builders, as they are concerned with rendering xml
